        <h3>Crowd-Sourced map of historic locations and events</h3>
        <p>
            I made this site in order to create an overview over historic locations. 
            Both because of interest but also in the future would like to travel to these locations.
        </p>
        <p>Right now this site <b>only contains historic locations and events from the Classical Antiquity-Era</b> but in the future hopefully expand to cover other eras as well.</p>
        <p>The Classical Antiquity-era spans between 8th century BC and the 6th century AD, this means mostly ancient Rome and Greek.</p>
        <h4>So please only add events and locations from this timeðŸ˜„</h4>
